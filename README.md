# LSTM-Text-Generator
Text generation can be considered a very important feature of AI-based tools. it comes very useful in machines which are supposed to become more interactive towards humans. smart gadgets like smart-speakers, home assistants use text generation in some forms.
This project utilizes LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) Text Generator to train the model on the Enron corpus or a text source of our choice.
